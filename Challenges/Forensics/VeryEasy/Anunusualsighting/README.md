> - Tình huống: Khi công tác chuẩn bị dần đi đến hồi kết và sự kiện "The Fray" ngày càng đến gần, đội ngũ mới thành lập của chúng tôi đã bắt tay vào tái cấu trúc ứng dụng CMS phục vụ cho cuộc thi. Tuy nhiên, sau một thời gian, chúng tôi phát hiện ra rằng rất nhiều phần công việc đã thực hiện bỗng nhiên biến mất một cách đầy bí ẩn! Chúng tôi đã trích xuất được các tệp nhật ký SSH (SSH Logs) và lịch sử lệnh Bash (Bash History) từ máy chủ phát triển (dev server) đang gặp vấn đề. Phe nào tìm ra thủ phạm sẽ nhận được một phần thưởng cực lớn khi cuộc thi chính thức bắt đầu! Lưu ý: Thời gian hoạt động của Korp là từ 09:00 đến 19:00.

> - Giải nén thu được 2 file `sshd.log` và `bash_history.txt` 
> - File `sshd.log` chứa nhật ký của dịch vụ SSH 
> - `bash_history.txt` chứa lịch sử lệnh

|                     |             our newly established team has started work on refactoring the new CMS application for the competition. |
|                     |                  However, after some time we noticed that a lot of our work mysteriously has been disappearing!     |
|                     |                     We managed to extract the SSH Logs and the Bash History from our dev server in question.        |
|                     |               The faction that manages to uncover the perpetrator will have a massive bonus come the competition!   |
